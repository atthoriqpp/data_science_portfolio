Which universities are most popular with international students?\n    - What can we learn about the student-per-staff ratios at these universities? Are there any universities where there are a lot more students than staff, or vice versa?\n    - Are there any universities that are a more popular choice for a particular gender?\n2.

This means that, on average, each academic staff member has about 16 students to teach and support.

","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Question 2: What about these universities that have more students than staff (and vice versa)?\n\nA good university will provide its students with the best learning experience and a balanced workload for its staff. However, when there are more students than staff, it can lead to several problems, despite the potential for lower overhead costs and increased revenue:\n\n- Students may not receive the best learning support. This is because staff may not be able to effectively manage each student in the class. A common phenomenon is that staff may prioritize students who are perceived as being gifted or active, while neglecting other students. This can lead to students feeling unsupported and having to rely on their own individual efforts to succeed.\n- Overworked and stressed staff may burn out, which can negatively impact their teaching performance. For example, they may perform poorly or even miss class altogether, especially if they have other important commitments.\n\nBut what if there are more staffs than students? Does it mean that it's better? Let's first discuss the better aspects:\n\n- Students will receive more learning support. This will make the classroom more personalized and students may request for support at any time, whether inside the classroom or outside.\n- Staffs will be more aware to their students condition and can quickly spot and treat students with educational problems (for example, declining grades). This will make the student aware of their educational conditions and be guided for improvements until graduation phase.\n\nThen, there are several assumptions regarding the downside of this condition:\n\n- The overhead cost for staff resources will be higher. This may be mitigated by increasing the admission/tuition fees but will only attract future students with a more stable/higher income (unless there's a scholarship program, but this will only capture a handful size of students)\n- Universities may struggle to allocate staff resources effectively. There may be excess staff members that may result in underutilized resources and may lead to increased overhead costs.\n\nBeware, though. According to the article [\"Learn What the Student to Faculty Ratio Means (and What It Doesn't)\"](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-s-a-good-student-to-faculty-ratio-for-a-college-4134430) by Allen Grove, the student-per-staff ratio doesn't tell the whole story. Many other factors contribute to a student's experience at a university. A high student to staff ratio doesn't necessarily mean that the university's learning support is poor, especially at research universities, where many staff members spend little time with students. Based on this article, a student-per-staff ratio of over 20 is generally considered to be challenging for university staff to provide good learning support.\n\nLet's see which universities have more students than the staff by seeing the distribution first.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, ax = plt.subplots()\nsns.histplot(data = df, x = 'n_student_per_staff', bins = 100, ax = ax, color = 'darkblue')\nsns.despine(right = True)\n\nax.set_xticks(range(0, 250, 30))\nax.set_title('Distribution of Student-per-Staff ratios', pad = 38, x = -0.12, ha = 'left', size = 14)\nax.text(s = 'Across all universities', x = -41, y = 390, color = '#4C4E52', size = 11)\nax.set_xlabel('STUDENT-PER-STAFF RATIO', color = '#6F7378', labelpad = 7)\nax.set_xticklabels(ax.get_xticklabels(), color = '#6F7378')\nax.set_ylabel('FREQUENCY', color = '#6F7378', labelpad = 7)\nax.set_yticklabels(ax.get_yticklabels(), color = '#6F7378')\nax.tick_params(color = '#6F7378')\n\nfor spine in ax.spines.values():\n    spine.set_edgecolor('#6F7378')\n\nplt.show()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-10T06:16:38.874545Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-10T06:16:38.874956Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-10T06:16:39.310740Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-11-10T06:16:38.874922Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-10T06:16:39.309687Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The typical student-per-staff ratio is around 10-25, but a few universities have a ratio of over 60.

However, there are both pros and cons to having more students than staff or more staff than students.\n\nHaving more students than staff:\n- Pros: Lower overhead costs and increased revenue\n- Cons: Students may not receive the best learning support, staff may burn out and perform poorly\n\nHaving more staff than students:\n- Pros: Students will receive more learning support, staff will be more aware of their students' conditions\n- Cons: Higher overhead costs, universities may struggle to allocate staff resources effectively\n\nIt is important to note that the student-per-staff ratio does not tell the whole story. Many other factors contribute to a student's experience at a university, such as the type of university, the amount of time staff members spend with students, and the availability of resources. A student-per-staff ratio of over 20 is generally considered challenging for university staff to provide good learning support.\n\nMost universities in this dataset have a student-per-staff ratio of 10-25, but 21 universities have a concerning ratio of over 60, with some as high as over 100. These universities include:\n\n1. University of South Africa (232)\n2. University of Franca (160)\n3. EAN University (143)\n4. University of the Highlands and Islands (131)\n5. Payame Noor University (125)\n6. Arab Open University - Kuwait (104)\n7. Open University of Catalonia (101)\n\nMost universities with a student-to-staff ratio over 60 have a low proportion of international students, suggesting that they are intended for local students and are less visible to international students. However, the Arab Open University - Kuwait is an exception, with a 60-70% international student proportion.\n\nThis raises an important question for future analysis: \"Why do universities that are mostly filled with local students have such concerning student-to-staff ratios?\". This could lead to less support and a worse study experience for students. However, answering this question accurately requires more relevant data, such as university resources and staffing, which is not publicly available.\n\nMost universities with a high student-per-staff ratio are ranked across all rank brackets, but a few have surprisingly high ranks. This suggests that these universities have other factors contributing to their ranking, despite their high student-per-staff ratios. Eight universities with high student-per-staff ratios are yet to be ranked.","metadata":{}}]}
