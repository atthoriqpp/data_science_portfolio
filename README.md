# Data Science Portfolio
A repository for data science and analytics projects. Portfolios are presented as Jupyter Notebooks/SQL Query Files, Dashboards, and/or Reports (PDF). For Jupyter Notebooks, use the `requirements.txt` file in each project folder to run the notebooks in your environment.

## About me
A driven business administration graduate with a passion for data science. Recently completed Rakamin Academy's Data Science Bootcamp and was awarded the runner-up spot for Best Final Project Team. Proficient in Python, SQL, and Looker Studio, he is always eager to expand his knowledge in the dynamic field of data science.

Before his data science journey, he demonstrated his entrepreneurial skills by launching his coffee shop business in 2019. He later contributed to a 20% increase in clients at GOODVIBES Creative.

Now, he seeks opportunities to apply his data science expertise to real-world scenarios, empowering companies to make informed decisions driven by data insights.

## Projects
- ### Exploratory Analysis and Visualization
  - **Analyzing E-Commerce Business Performance with SQL**
    
     An exploratory data visualization study delved into the core metrics driving an e-commerce's success. Identified actionable insights by analyzing customer activity, revenue, product performance, and payment types and designed a custom dashboard for stakeholders. Additionally, the project showcased PgAdmin (PostgreSQL) for efficient database management.

  - **Project Based Virtual Intern: Kimia Farma x Rakamin Academy Datamart and Dashboard Building**
    
     A project that produced a datamart and built a dashboard for Kimia Farma, an Indonesian pharmaceutical producer and distributor, covering sales data from January 2022 to June 2022. This involved creating a database from raw data and processing sales information using PostgreSQL. As the final step, I developed a sales dashboard using Looker Studio, highlighting key metrics like total sales, average sales, total transactions, top sales by location, top-selling brands, top-selling products, and top customers by store type.
