# Data Analytics Portfolio
Repository containing portfolios of data analytics projects completed by me for data science skill developments. The portfolios are presented in the form of Jupyter Notebook and PDF containing a more visually pleasing report. If you want to run the notebooks in your own environment, you can use the attached requirements.txt in each project's folder.

## Projects
- ### Analysis and Visualization
